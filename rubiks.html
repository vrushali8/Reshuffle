                            equivalent of a Rubik's Cube. The cube consists of 8 pieces, all corners.In March 1970,
                            Larry D. Nichols invented a 2×2×2 "Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups" and filed a
                            Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together with magnets. Nichols
                            was granted U.S. Patent 3,655,201 on April 11, 1972, two years before Rubik invented his
                            Cube. Nichols assigned his patent to his employer Moleculon Research Corp., which sued Ideal
                            in 1982. In 1984, Ideal lost the patent infringement suit and appealed. In 1986, the appeals
                            court affirmed the judgment that Rubik's 2×2×2 Pocket Cube infringed Nichols's patent, but
                            overturned the judgment on Rubik's 3×3×3 Cube.[1]Any permutation of the eight corners is
                            possible (8! positions), and seven of them can be independently rotated (37 positions).
                            There is nothing identifying the orientation of the cube in space, reducing the positions by
                            a factor of 24. This is because all 24 possible positions and orientations of the first
                            corner are equivalent due to the lack of fixed centers. This factor does not appear when
                            calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed
                            centers which identify the cube's spatial orientation. The number a of positions that
                            require n any (half or quarter) turns and number q of positions that require n quarter turns
                            only are:</p>

                                <p class="card-text mb-auto">Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in
                                    1974[1][2] by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik.
                                    Originally called the Magic Cube,[3] the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by
                                    Ideal Toy Corp. in 1980[4] via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom
                                    Kremer.[5] The Rubik's Cube won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for
                                    Best Puzzle. As of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide,[6][7]
                                    making it the world's top-selling puzzle game.[8][9] It is widely considered to be
                                    the world's best-selling toy.[10] On the original classic Rubik's Cube, each of the
                                    six faces was covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours: white,
                                    red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. Some later versions of the cube have been
                                    updated to use coloured plastic panels instead, which prevents peeling and
                                    fading.[11] In currently[according to whom?] sold models, white is opposite yellow,
                                    blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white, and blue are
                                    arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement.[12] On early cubes, the position
                                    of the colours varied from cube to cube.[13] An internal pivot mechanism enables
                                    each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be
                                    solved, each face must be returned to have only one colour. Similar puzzles have now
                                    been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of
                                    them by Rubik.</p>

                                            Rubik's Cube. It was made and patented by Uwe Mèffert after the original 3
                                            layered Rubik's Cube by Erno Rubik, and introduced by Tomy Toys of Japan
                                            (then the 3rd largest toy company in the world) in 1981.[1]The Pyraminx was
                                            first conceived by Mèffert in 1970. He did nothing with his design until
                                            1981 when he first brought it to Hong Kong for production. Uwe is fond of
                                            saying had it not been for Erno Rubik's invention of the cube, his Pyraminx
                                            would have never been produced.[citation needed]</p>

                                                    The Rubik's Revenge (also known as the Master Cube) is a 4×4×4
                                                    version of Rubik's Cube. It was released in 1981. Invented by Péter
                                                    Sebestény, the Rubik's Revenge was nearly called the Sebestény Cube
                                                    until a somewhat last-minute decision changed the puzzle's name to
                                                    attract fans of the original Rubik's Cube.[1] Unlike the original
                                                    puzzle (and other odd-numbered puzzles like the 5×5×5 cube), it has
                                                    no fixed facets: the centre facets (four per face) are free to move
                                                    to different positions. Methods for solving the 3×3×3 cube work for
                                                    the edges and corners of the 4×4×4 cube, as long as one has
                                                    correctly identified the relative positions of the colours — since
                                                    the centre facets can no longer be used for identification.The
                                                    puzzle consists of 56 unique miniature cubes ("cubies") on the
                                                    surface. These consist of 24 centres which show one colour each, 24
                                                    edges which show two colours each, and 8 corners which show three
                                                    colours each. The original Rubik's Revenge can be taken apart
                                                    without much difficulty, typically by turning one side through a 30°
                                                    angle and prying an edge upward until it dislodges. The original
                                                    mechanism designed by Sebestény uses a grooved ball to hold the
                                                    centre pieces in place. The edge pieces are held in place by the
                                                    centres and the corners are held in place by the edges, much like
                                                    the original cube. There are three mutually perpendicular grooves
                                                    for the centre pieces to slide through.</p>
